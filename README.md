This is my collection of configuration files for various applications I use. 

Conky
---------
I recently added conky to my PC setup and I find it very satisfying working with it. The configuration is really simple and I oriented on the work of hellfire (http://conky.sourceforge.net/conky-hellfire.png)

Adjusted for my current system and some things in planning

TODO:
* volume information
* weather 

i3
---------
i3 is a wonderful tiling window manager

i3bar allows the integration of conky status informations
